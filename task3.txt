1. The two versions both generate the desired correct solution (although they differ slightly: 2-3 for one and 3-2 for the other in an intermediate gather step). The extended version only reads 101 programs while the baseline reads 616, so the extended version is definitely faster.

2. Based on my analysis, the part of the question that contributes the most is the phrase "spread them to wide format". Looking over the outputs reveals that the extended synthesizer gets the combination of functions almost immediately and just has to experiment with parameters, providing solid reason to believe that the synthesizer received clues from those function words.
