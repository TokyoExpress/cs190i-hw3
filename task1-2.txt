The client appears to always follow the same order of enumeration, as running the output multiple times always finds the solution after 616 tries, indicating that the order of programs it sees is the same. Reviewing the code shows that the BidirectEnumerator object creates a series of lines and traverses them simultaneously rather than exhaustively searching, but I'm not entirely sure how the enumerator actually works.
